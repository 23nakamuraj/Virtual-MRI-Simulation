Title: Developing a Cost-Effective MRI Machine for Underserved Communities

Abstract:
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical diagnostic tool in modern healthcare, yet its accessibility remains highly limited in many parts of the world due to high costs, including infrastructure requirements (exceeding $1,500,000) and the scarcity of MRI-specialized professionals. Organizations such as the Open Source Imaging Initiative (OSII) are working to create affordable ($50,000) and accessible ultra-low-field MRI machines for underserved communities. While ultra-low-field MRI offers advantages such as accessibility, safety, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use, it also has significant drawbacks, including longer scan times, low image resolution (low SNR), and technological limitations that reduce its effectiveness as a diagnostic tool. To overcome these challenges, I proposed optimizing mechanical parameters using a virtual ultra-low-field MRI machine simulator. Furthermore, AI-tools are proposed to diagnose diseases and 3D reconstruct the subject using raw MRI data

This project leverages advancements in computational power and artificial intelligence to develop a novel virtual MRI framework and AI tools that address the limitations of ultra-low-field MRIs. A brain model is first created as the subject for the virtual MRI machine, which is built using computational models that replicate the physics of MRI, allowing for the generation of k-space data and the subsequent reconstruction of 3D brain models. AI tools are used to generate high-resolution reconstructions of 3D brain models from noisy data and to accurately identify brain defects.
