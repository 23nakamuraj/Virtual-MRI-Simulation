## Abstract

Title: Developing a Cost-Effective MRI Machine for Underserved Communities

Abstract:
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical diagnostic tool in modern healthcare, yet its accessibility remains highly limited in many parts of the world due to high costs, including infrastructure requirements (exceeding $1,500,000) and the scarcity of MRI-specialized professionals. Organizations such as the Open Source Imaging Initiative (OSII) are working to create affordable ($50,000) and accessible ultra-low-field MRI machines for underserved communities. While ultra-low-field MRI offers advantages such as accessibility, safety, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use, it also has significant drawbacks, including longer scan times, low image resolution (low SNR), and technological limitations that reduce its effectiveness as a diagnostic tool. To overcome these challenges, I proposed optimizing mechanical parameters using a virtual ultra-low-field MRI machine simulator. Furthermore, AI-tools are proposed to diagnose diseases and 3D reconstruct the subject using raw MRI data

This project leverages advancements in computational power and artificial intelligence to develop a novel virtual MRI framework and AI tools that address the limitations of ultra-low-field MRIs. A brain model is first created as the subject for the virtual MRI machine, which is built using computational models that replicate the physics of MRI, allowing for the generation of k-space data and the subsequent reconstruction of 3D brain models. AI tools are used to generate high-resolution reconstructions of 3D brain models from noisy data and to accurately identify brain defects.


## Virtual MRI Machines:

In a real MRI machine, strong magnetic fields are used to align hydrogen atoms in a specific orientation. When a radiofrequency (RF) pulse is applied perpendicular to the main magnetic field, the hydrogen atoms absorb this energy and change their orientation. As the RF pulse is turned off, the hydrogen atoms quickly relax back to their original alignment, releasing energy in the process. This energy is detected by RF coils, which encode the signals into the frequency domain. These frequency-domain signals are then transformed into images through an inverse Fourier transformation.

A virtual MRI machine can replicate this process computationally. They simulate the interactions between magnetic fields and hydrogen atoms, as well as the RF pulses and the subsequent signal detection. The result of a virtual MRI machine is MRI data identical to that of a real MRI scan. In addition to replicating scans, virtual MRI machines are not limited by physical or cost constraints, making it possible to conduct theoretical studies. Virtual machines can be used in ultra-low field MRI development to fine-tune parameters and find the best combinations for creating usable data.

By adjusting parameters in the simulation, researchers can explore various scenarios that may not be feasible with current technology. For instance, they can simulate MRI scans at higher or lower magnetic field strengths. Virtual MRI machines provide a powerful tool for testing and validating new ideas and improvements in MRI technology without the need for physical prototypes.
